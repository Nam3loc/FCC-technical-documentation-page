            <p>Disc Golf is an up and coming sport that has been sweeping the world since the beginning of Quarantine in
                March 2020. It is similar to golf in that you start on a tee pad and you throw your discs to the hole.
                The goal is to get as many strokes (throws) as possible.</p>

            <p>Instead of using a ball and golf clubs, disc golfers uses discs or frisbees. There are many different
                brands and plastics that go into the making of these surprisingly complex discs, which affect their
                flight, glide, and even the direction that they fall to.</p>

            <p>Disc Golf is similar to golf in that there are courses specifically designed with 18 holes to play a full
                round of golf. Disc golf on the other hand is different because most courses are free to play and

            <p>Disc golf, similarly to golf, does not have many necessary equipment. The main piece of equipment used in
                disc golf is a disc bag or some sort of cart to carry your discs in from hole to hole. There are many
                different brands and style of discs bags out there, and we have seen a new surge of disc carts beginning
                to show up as many disc golfers choice of equipment.</p>
